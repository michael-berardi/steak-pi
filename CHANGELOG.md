# Changelog

## 0.5.2

- Verify primary-host ownership using the managed TUI context, pane terminal
  descriptors, and canonical session path; preserve identity across reloads,
  retry publication, and clear only owned pane bindings.
- Add native UltraTerm inbox delivery with idle gating, bounded Unix-socket
  transport, receipt deduplication, and persisted session evidence before
  recording delivery. Recorded delivery does not prove model-read.
- Fail USAP worker startup early when its own Pi dependencies cannot resolve,
  with actionable repair guidance and no automatic install or model fallback.
- Retain the existing vendored UltraCompress implementation and Pi peer ranges;
  this patch does not upgrade the compaction algorithm.
